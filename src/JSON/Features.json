It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",

Although we can't all specifically relate to being a gay teenager, it's easy to empathise with Simon as he progresses through the many ups and downs of High School. Well written characters and a likeable cast made this heartfelt dramedy into probably the best of its kind in 2018."

Director Bart Layton turns the anxiety up to 10 with some of the year's most intense scenes. It's a hell of a cinema experience."
